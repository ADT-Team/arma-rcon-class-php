# Arma RCon Class for PHP (ARC)

ARC is a lightweight PHP class, which let's you easily send commands via  RCon to your Arma server. See "Supported Server" for a full list of supported Arma games.
<br>
<br>
## Supported Servers
Please consider that mods normally don't change the BattlEye server settings, so this class also works for sending RCON commands  to servers running mods (e.g Altis Life, DayZ, Epoch etc.).

| App ID        | Game          | RCON Support       |
|---------------|---------------|:------------------:|
|233780         | Arma 3        | :white_check_mark: |
|33935          | Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead       | :white_check_mark: |

## Requirements
ARC only requires **PHP5**, nothing more!
<br>
<br>
## Installation
To use ARC in your project, just inlcude `rcon.php` in your project.
```php
require_once '{PATH_TO_RCON.PHP}/rcon.php';
```
<br>
## Examples
#### Getting started
After including `rcon.php` in your project, you need to create a new object, e.g:
```php
$rcon = new ARC("Your server IP", Port, "RCon password");
```
Then you are able to send commands with the `command()` function:
```php
$rcon->command("Say -1 hello!"); // To say something in global chat, you may use 'say_global()', see 'Functions'
```
ARC will throw Exceptions if anything goes wrong, so you could do a try-catch function:
```php
try 
{
    $rcon = new ARC("Your server IP", Port, "RCon password");
    $rcon->say_player(0, "hey!");
} 
catch (Exception $e) 
{
    echo "Ups! Something went wrong: ".$e->getMessage();
}
```
#### Options
ARC can send a heartbeat packet to the server. In order to do this, you need to enable it:
```php
$rcon = new ARC("Your server IP", Port, "RCon password", array (
        'heartbeat' => true,
    ));
```
Another option is `timeout_seconds`, which sets a timeout value on the connection:
```php
$rcon = new ARC("Your server IP", Port, "RCon password", array (
        'send_heartbeat'       => true,
        'timeout_seconds'      => 1, // by default 1 second
    ));
```
<br>
## Functions
ARC features many functions to send BattlEye commands easier:
* `command()`:  Sends any command to the BattlEye server and returns its answer as a string.
* `kick_player($player)`:  Kicks a player who is currently on the server.
* `get_players()`:  Returns a list of all players online.
* `say_global($message)`:  Sends a global message to all players.
* `say_player($player, $message)`:  Sends a message to a specific player.
* `get_missions()`:  Returns a list of the available missions on the server.
* `load_scripts()`:  Loads the "scripts.txt" file without the need to restart the server.
* `max_ping($ping)`:  Changes the MaxPing value. If a player has a higher ping, he will be kicked from the server.
* `change_password($password)`:  Changes the RCon password.
* `load_bans()`:  (Re)load the BE ban list from bans.txt.
* `get_bans()`:  Show a list of all BE server bans.
* `ban_player($player, $reason, $time)`:  Ban a player's BE GUID from the server. If time is not specified or 0, the ban will be permanent; if reason is not specified the player will be kicked with "Banned".
* `add_ban($player, $reason, $time)`:  Same as "ban_player", but allows to ban a player that is not currently on the server.
* `remove_ban($banid)`:  Removes a ban.
* `write_bans()`:  Removes expired bans from bans file.
